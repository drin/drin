### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ±
My name is Aldrin (https://pronoun.is/he) and Iâ€™m about to start my 3rd year as a PhD student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz.

ğŸ‘¯
Iâ€™m advised by Peter Alvaro and we work with Carlos Maltzahn, Jeff LeFevre, and Aaron Chu on declarative programmable storage.

ğŸ”­
Iâ€™m most interested in data management systems, bioinformatics, programming languages, and distributed systems.

ğŸ’¬
Feel free to ask me about anything, especially if you're interested in grad school, software development, bioinformatics, or just socializing!
