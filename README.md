### Hi there 👋

🌱
My name is Aldrin ([he/him][doc-pronoun]) and I am currently a 6th year PhD student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz.

👯
I am advised by Peter Alvaro and principally work with Philip Kufeldt, Josh Stuart, and Jeff LeFevre.

🔭
My research interest is in the intersection of data management systems, storage systems, programming languages, and bioinformatics.

👨🏽‍💻
Additionally, I am trying to contribute to the [Apache Arrow][community-arrow] and [Human Cell Atlas][community-hca] communities.

💬
Feel free to ask me about anything, e.g. grad school, software development, bioinformatics, or just socializing!
